# C Programming Mastery

A comprehensive learning journey through the C programming language, featuring structured coursework, practical exercises, and personal notes from my programming studies.

## 🎯 Overview

This repository serves as my personal knowledge base and practice ground for mastering C programming. It contains organized materials from lectures, hands-on coding exercises, and detailed notes that document my progression from fundamental concepts to advanced programming techniques.

## 📚 Learning Materials

### Lecture Resources
- **PDF Materials** (`_lectures/`): Complete course lectures and reference materials
- **Personal Notes** (`_notebooks/`): Detailed notebooks with code examples, concepts, and observations
- **Practical Exercises** (`_practicals/`): Coding challenges and project assignments with problem statements

### Code Examples
- **`test.c`**: A simple demonstration program to verify the development environment
- **Structured Exercises**: Progressive coding challenges organized by topic and difficulty

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Required Tools
- **Visual Studio Code** - Primary code editor
- **C/C++ Extension** - For IntelliSense, debugging, and code navigation
- **MinGW-w64 GCC Compiler** - Located at `D:\mingw64\bin`
- **Git** - Version control and repository management

### Environment Configuration
